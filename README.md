tictactoe
=========

This is an unbeatable version of tic tac toe. This implementation uses
the MiniMax algorithm and implements a heuristic that is based on the
depth of the minimax search. A similar implementation is talked about
here: (Explanation of
MiniMax)[http://www.neverstopbuilding.com/minimax]. This implementation
uses an unbeatable heuristic but could be limited in depth to give the
player a chance.
